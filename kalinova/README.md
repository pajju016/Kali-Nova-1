# 🛡️ Kalinova – Intelligent Kali Linux Control Platform

Kalinova is a Human-Centered Ethical Hacking Platform built on top of Kali Linux.

It transforms traditional command-line security tools into an intelligent, guided, GUI-driven workflow system.

---

# 🚀 Project Vision

Traditional penetration testing tools are powerful but:
- Complex for beginners
- Manual workflow driven
- No structured risk scoring
- No guided next-step decision system

Kalinova solves this by providing:
- GUI Control Center
- Integrated security tools
- Risk scoring engine
- Decision suggestion engine
- Structured logging
- Report generation
- Custom Kali ISO build
